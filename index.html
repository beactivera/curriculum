            <p>The instruction is based on projects, which provide a basis for understanding practice, and the tasks are normally carried out in groups. Classroom instruction is gradually being replaced by advisor-based instruction.</p>

            <p>The project tasks and the final project in particular, are independent tasks that you carry out on the basis of the theory that you have learned. The projects should be based on specific cases from businesses as far as this is possible. You will be given good advice and constructive criticism along the way.</p>

            <p>You must be prepared to make an independent effort and cooperate with your fellow students. The type of instruction gives you experience that you can use for solving both known and new issues. </p>
